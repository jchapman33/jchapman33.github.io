EPISODE: 101 - A Skype conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithhopper">Keith Hopper</a>.  Our conversation is roughly 17-minutes and covers a range of topics. Skype skips a few times but the audio is okay throughout the conversation.

EPISODE: 103 - A Zoom conversation with <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/colemercer">Cole mercer</a>.  Our conversation was roughly 35-minutes, I had to edit it down to 19-minutes, so if you’re interested in the full/uncut version just email me.  Cole was very gracious in sharing a discounted online course that he taught at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job/?couponCode=OCTOBERSURPRISE ">Udemy</a>, worth checking out.  The course is regularly $195 but with Cole’s coupon code of “OCTOBERSURPRISE” the course is $10, pretty awesome!  Thank you Cole!
